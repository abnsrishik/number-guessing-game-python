# 🎯 Number Guessing Game – Python Implementation

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **command-line number guessing game** developed using Python.

The program:

* Randomly generates a number between 1 and 100
* Allows the user to choose a difficulty level
* Provides feedback after each guess
* Limits the number of attempts based on difficulty
* Ends the game when the user wins or runs out of attempts

This project focuses on **conditional logic, function-based design, and game state management**.

## 🎯 Why This Project?

I built this project to strengthen my understanding of:

* Random number generation
* Control flow in interactive programs
* Difficulty-based logic branching
* Loop control and state tracking

The implementation uses separate functions for easy and hard modes, improving code organization and clarity.

## 🧠 Core Concepts Used

* Python functions
* Conditional statements
* Loops (`while`)
* Random number generation using `random.randint()`
* User input handling
* Game state control
* Logical comparisons

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/number-guessing-game-python.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory:

   ```bash
   cd number-guessing-game-python
   ```

3. Run the program:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🎮 How the Game Works

1. The system generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2. The user selects:

   * Easy mode → 10 attempts
   * Hard mode → 5 attempts
3. The user guesses the number.
4. The program provides feedback:

   * “Too High”
   * “Too Low”
5. The game ends when:

   * The correct number is guessed
   * Attempts reach zero

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

* Designing interactive command-line programs
* Managing state variables (attempts remaining)
* Structuring code using functions
* Implementing difficulty-based branching logic
* Handling win and loss conditions

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Add input validation for non-numeric entries
* Add replay functionality without restarting the program
* Track score across multiple rounds
* Add dynamic difficulty levels
* Convert into a GUI or web-based version
